Project Name: 
Research on Fama-French Factor Models and Swap Design Using MATLAB

Project Description:
The file CPFE_project_main.m is the main program code for this project, which consists of two parts. The first part focuses on the application of the Fama-French three-factor (FF3) and five-factor (FF5) models in the Chinese stock market, exploring the explanatory power of these models. The second part involves designing interest rate swap products with different maturities using the Vasicek interest rate model and Monte Carlo simulation.

Project Language:
Matlab

Project Structure:
The project is divided into three branches. The team leader is responsible for task allocation and maintaining the Main Branch, while the other two team members are responsible for developing branches related to the Fama-French factor models and swap design, respectively.
